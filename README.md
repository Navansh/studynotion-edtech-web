### ⚠️ Important!
In order to use this on a local machine you need the API keys.
I've added a ".env.example" file that enlists all the necessary API keys required to run this app smoothly on the browser, Please make sure all those API keys are procured and filled before you start the app locally.

### Starting the application

```bash
# To run the backend and frontend simultaneously
npm run dev
# To build the frontend
npm run build
```

### Run the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
